            <p class="texto">During a recent Microchallenge week, I tried to make my first prototype that blends 
                ancient craftsmanship with AI technologies. The goal was too ambitious for the week: to preserve traditional 
                artisan movements using machine learning and deep learning.</p>

        <div class="texto3">
            <h2 class="subtitulo">Initial Challenges</h2>
            <p class="texto">The week was tougher than anticipated as I couldn't complete my prototype on time. However, 
                this setback only fueled my determination. Post-challenge, I refined the prototype, achieving a functional model 
                that kind of shows AIâ€™s potential in educational settings for traditional crafts.</p>

            <h2 class="subtitulo">Learning and Prototyping</h2>
            <p class="texto">Developing this prototype pushed me beyond my academic comfort zone, forcing me to learn new tools 
                crucial for my research. This process wasn't just about mastering new technologies, it reshaped my approach, 
                making innovation and adaptability my key assets.</p>

        <div class="texto5">
            <h2 class="subtitulo">Looking Ahead</h2>
            <p class="texto">In the near future I will also like to enhance the prototypeâ€™s functionality and accessibility. 
                It would be thrilling to implement new technologies, including AR and AI assistants, to physically prototype a product. 
                This advancement would not only change how we transmit and preserve the knowledge of traditional craftsmanship but also 
                create a more immersive, interactive learning environment for a modern audience.
