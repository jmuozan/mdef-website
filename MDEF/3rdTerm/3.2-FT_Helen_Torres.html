            <p class="texto">Haraway's ideas often challenge our conventional understanding of science, technology, and society, 
                pushing us toward a more integrated and ethical approach to how we interact with the world and each other.</p>

            <h2 class="subtitulo">response-ability</h2>
            <p class="texto">One of the central themes of the seminar was "respons-ability," a term critical to Haraway‚Äôs philosophy. 
                It calls for a greater awareness of our connection to other life forms and our surroundings. Torres expanded on this by 
                highlighting the moral responsibilities that emerge from our interactions with the world. This concept isn't just about 
                reacting to external scenarios; it's about being consciously aware of the outcomes of our actions and being answerable 
                for them.</p>

            <h2 class="subtitulo">Some Cultural Insights</h2>
            <p class="texto">The tour delved deeply into the cultural essence of L'Hospitalet, showing how it's reshaping 
                both the physical and socio-cultural landscapes. Baeza emphasized the role of cultural institutions in this 
                transformation, prompting us to consider the broader impacts of our design choices and collaborations. It was 
                a compelling call to merge creativity with cultural sensitivity and sustainability in our projects.</p>

            <h2 class="subtitulo"></h2>
            <p class="texto">Although the discussion was intellectually stimulating and provided a novel perspective on responsibility, 
                I found it slightly deviated to my current project, which delves into the nexus of artisanship and technology. My work is 
                firmly anchored in exploring how traditional craftsmanship can integrate with and benefit from technological innovations. 
                This requires a practical, hands-on approach to technology, which somewhat diverges from Haraway‚Äôs more theoretical approach.

        <div class="texto6">
            <h2 class="subtitulo">Reflections on the activity</h2>
            <p class="texto">Nevertheless, the idea of "respons-ability" sparked several compelling thoughts related to my thesis. It prompts 
                considerations about the ethical dimensions of merging technology with traditional crafts. Questions about how to ensure this 
                amalgamation honors the cultural heritage and integrity of the communities involved in these crafts. How do we find a balance 
                where technology supports rather than detracts from the essence of craftsmanship?</p>
            <p class="texto">While the direct relevance of Haraway's theories to my project may not be that obvious, the ethical perspective 
                she offers on technological engagements is immensely valuable.</p>
