            <p class="texto">The following seminar was all about curating our very own MDEFFest, a festival where we get to showcase our projects. The entire class was divided into clusters based on our interests, and each cluster organized their own mini-festivals. Our cluster's final name was ACT, which stands for Actively Creating Tomorrows.</p>

            <h2 class="subtitulo">The Journey to ACT üåè</h2>
            <p class="texto">Being part of ACT was a really cool experience as it helped me shape my project's narrative. We started by brainstorming and discussing what we are passionate about. The common thread that emerged was our desire to actively shape the future through our projects. Whether it was AI, IoT, or innovative product design, we all had a shared vision of making tomorrow better through our creations.</p>

            <h2 class="subtitulo">Brainstorming & Collaboration </h2>
            <p class="texto">On our cluster meetings we bounced ideas off each other, and it was amazing to see how our diverse perspectives came together to make the festival possible. One key aspect of our collaboration was the way we integrated technology and creativity. We didn't just want to present our projects; we wanted to create an experience that would inspire others to think about the future and their role in it.</p>
            <p class="texto">This experience idea ended up beign showcased in a common open exhibition where everyone was able to interact with the different stands</p>

            <h2 class="subtitulo">The exhibition</h2>
            <p class="texto">On the base of this interaction design I decided to make a webapp for users to interact with my project AI.RTISANSHIP. People in the exhibition was able to use the web, train their movememt and see how well it work. This way, they could have an idea of the way it can be applied to different crafts</p>

            <p class="texto">Curating the MDEFest with my peers was a great experience. It was a testament to what we can achieve when we come together with a common goal and what a good showcase can do to a poject. I'm excited to see how the ideas and connections we made during this seminar will shape our future projects.</p>
