            <p class="texto">The introduction to philosophical and ethical considerations in technology via the Design Ethics seminar 
                offered a powerful framework for understanding how deeply our technologies are entwined with our moral fabric. Delving 
                into topics ranging from the neutrality of technology to the responsibilities of designers, this seminar acted as a profound 
                call to assess not only how we create and use technology but also the ethical implications embedded within these processes.</p>

            <h2 class="subtitulo">üåê Technology as a Reflection of Societal Values</h2>
            <p class="texto">One of the central themes from the seminar is the idea that technology is not just a collection of tools but a 
                reflection of societal values and structures. It "shows us what a society, a community, or a group with power values as 
                positive and what is undesirable and should be avoided"‚Äã‚Äã. This realization demands a rethinking of how we view our creations 
                in technology; they are not neutral but are deeply infused with ideological underpinnings.</p>

            <h2 class="subtitulo">üîÑ Technology and Design: Agents of Change</h2>
            <p class="texto">The seminar emphasized the dual role of technology and design as agents of change. Technology does not merely 
                exist; it acts. It has the power to shape and be shaped by society interactions and cultures. This dynamic is a central 
                key in the understanding of the ethical dimensions of technology. As technology molds society, it shapes our values and priorities, 
                often amplifying inequalities.</p>

            <p class="texto">The ethics surrounding my project that uses AI to preserve and teach traditional craftsmanship are complex and 
                multifaceted. At its core, the project is laudable for its effort to keep these ancient skills alive, promoting cultural 
                heritage and diversity in a globalized world. However, it also brings up important questions about the authenticity of 
                learning crafts through digital means. Can AI truly capture and replicate the nuanced skills of human artisans? Additionally, 
                there are critical considerations about fair compensation and recognition for the artisans whose expertise is digitized. 
                Issues of consent and the ownership of cultural knowledge also arise, especially for traditions that belong to indigenous or 
                local communities and may not be owned by individuals. While the project is forward-thinking, it must carefully address these 
                ethical concerns to ensure it serves the communities involved respectfully and does not unintentionally commercialize or 
                misuse cultural heritage.</p>
