            <p class="texto">In our recent seminar within the Master program, we took a deep dive into expanding the "Atlas of Weak Signals" 
                (AoWS), a pivotal tool designed by Mariana Quintero. The AoWS serves as a compass for navigating the future, helping us to 
                identify and interpret emerging trends that may soon transform our society.</p>

            <h2 class="subtitulo">Bridging the Gap Between Emerging Trends and Reality</h2>
            <p class="texto">Our group made emphasis on immersive technologies, which were used to enhance our understanding of potential 
                futures. We dynamically employed ontological and transition design principles to create new cards for the AoWS deck, each 
                depicting a vision of technologyâ€™s trajectory and its impacts on everyday life. Our explorations revealed how augmented and 
                virtual reality are evolving from mere tools to essential elements that reshape our interactions and worldviews. Highlights 
                included the Hybrid Availability Card, demonstrating the integration of virtual environments in sectors like education and 
                healthcare, and the Neurotechnology Card, predicting enhancements in human cognitive abilities through brain-computer 
                interfaces. Other significant cards, like the Imagining New Worlds for Mixed Reality and the Virtual Learning Spaces Card, 
                envision transformative scenarios in education and professional development. We also discussed the psychological effects of 
                technology with cards addressing healthier digital engagements and the social implications of immersive technologies, 
                suggesting ways to foster community within these spaces.</p>

            <h2 class="subtitulo">Reflections on this first step</h2>
            <p class="texto">Integrating the insights from the AoWS into my thesis on the blend of craftsmanship with new technologies 
                offers a compelling exercise. The atlas, with its forward-looking perspective, is instrumental in anticipating how 
                traditional skills can merge with futuristic tech. This merger not only preserves but also evolves craftsmanship, ensuring 
                its relevance in a digital future.</p>
            
            <p class="texto">Considering our focus on immersive realities, itâ€™s apparent that technologies like AR and VR could offer 
                artisans new ways to showcase their crafts, interact with materials, and even reach global markets without losing the 
                "essence" of their art.</p>

            <p class="texto">Moreover, the idea of expanding the AoWS deck with cards that specifically explore the reinvention and 
                adaptation of old jobs is intriguing. Such cards would serve as a creative catalyst, sparking ideas on how age old 
                practices can be reimagined through modern technologies. This addition could be a vital resource in my thesis, providing a 
                structured way to speculate and strategize on integrating enduring artisanal skills with innovative technologies.</p>

            <p class="texto">Overall, the seminar not only broadened our collective perspective but also provided me with valuable tools and 
                methodologies that align perfectly with my thesis goals. </p>
