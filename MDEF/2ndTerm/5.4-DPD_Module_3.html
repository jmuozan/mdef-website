            <p class="texto">In this module we did the design and development process of our custom spinning table, crafted with using CNC machining. This table features mechanism consisting of a spinning edge and bearings, allowing for smooth manual rotation.</p>

            <h2 class="subtituloprincipal">Concept and Design</h2>
            <p class="texto">The idea for the spinning table came from wanting to create a piece of furniture that‚Äôs both practical and fun to use. We envisioned it also working as a manual pottery wheel, so it had to look good and function well. We wanted it to be a centerpiece in any room (The class), catching attention by looking good. At the same time, we wanted the spinning feature to work smoothly, giving people an interactive experience. Whether used as a table or a pottery wheel, it needed to blend aesthetics with mechanics seamlessly. This way, it wouldn‚Äôt just be a piece of furniture but also something that adds a unique touch to any space.</p>

            <h2 class="subtituloprincipal">CNC Machining Process</h2>
            <p class="texto">CNC machining provided us with accuracy and an ability to produce intricate designs that we couldhave not achieved with laser cutting or 3d printing (Or they would've been more expensive). The process involved several stages:</p>
            <p class="texto"><strong></strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li class="texto"><strong>CAD Modeling:</strong> Detailed CAD drawing were created to plan the machining process.</li>
                <li class="texto"><strong>G-CODE making:</strong> Using the CAD drawing of every piece, a CNC program was written to guide the machining process.</li>
                <li class="texto"><strong>Material measuring:</strong> Wood pieces provided were measured to make sure the tolerances determined on the CAD drawing were correct.</li>
                <li class="texto"><strong>Machining: </strong>Components were machined setting up the g-code.</li>
                <li class="texto"><strong>Assembly: </strong>Once all parts were machined, the assembly of all parts was made.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2 class="subtituloprincipal">Final result</h2>
            <p class="texto">Even though we new the spinning functionality was going to be hard to achieve, the result did not work as intended. Maybe because of the quality of the bearings. As we used bearings around the lab they were not properly lubricated so the spin of them was not perfect.</p>
            <p class="texto">Also, even though the assembly of the pieces went good. the tolerance were the edge was going to be was not properly meassured.</p>
            <p class="texto">With all this considered, we can say that even though we didn't achive the expected result we were proud that we managed to assembly the piece furniture considering it was our first contact with this machine.</p>
