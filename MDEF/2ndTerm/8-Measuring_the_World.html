            <p class="texto">This seminar offered a deep dive into our data-driven world, 
                helping us examining how data influences our daily lives and encouraging us 
                to have critical and creative engagement with it.</p>

            <h2 class="subtitulo">A data driven world</h2>
            <p class="texto">In today's fast-paced digital age, our dependence on data has 
                become paramount. Every single day, an overwhelming amount of information pours 
                in from thousands of different sources worldwide: people engaging with social media, 
                businesses doing transactions, and machines collecting and 
                transmitting data points. This explosion in data creation is responsable adoption 
                of data analytics as a highly important tool that helps us to glean 
                meaningful insights from these vast pools of information.</p>

            <p class="texto">Nowadays, data analysis serves has become the new way of decision-making 
                processes, allowing organizations and governments to go through the massive volume of data to 
                discover valuable patterns and trends. Through the use of analytical 
                techniques, businesses can dicover important insights, find emerging opportunities, 
                and drive strategic initiatives forward.</p>
                
            <p class="texto">The significance of data analytics goes far beyond the corporate 
                realm. It has pentrated into every area of our society, influencing fields such as healthcare, 
                finance, and academia. The transformative potential of data analytics is boundless, 
                reshaping industries and revolutionizing the way we harness data to solve problems and 
                make informed decisions.</p>

            <h2 class="subtitulo">Call bullsh*t</h2>
            <p class="texto">In today's data-driven society, the importance of questioning misinformation 
                cannot be overstated. When navigating through a sea of data, it's crucial to distinguish fact 
                from fiction, and that's where calling out bullshit becomes essential. By challenging dubious 
                claims and flawed interpretations, individuals uphold the integrity of data-driven decision-making 
                processes.</p>

            <p class="texto">This practice isn't just about skepticism; it's about accountability and transparency. 
                It encourages critical thinking and scrutiny of data sources, methodologies, and assumptions. In fields 
                like journalism and public policy, calling out bullshit is vital for maintaining credibility and trust.</p>
                
            <p class="texto">In a world where misinformation can spread like wildfire, calling bullshit is a 
                responsibility we all share. It's about ensuring that decisions are based on accurate, reliable information, 
                and upholding the principles of honesty and integrity in our data-driven endeavors.</p>

            <p class="texto">Great examples that shows how a lack of basic statistics knowledge from general population usually leads to 
                missinformation getting a way into people's life can be seen mainly on twitter,
                where usually bold graphs with crazy affirmations get published and advertised as an unquestionable truth.
                Most of the times a major part of this graphs lack proper correlation (r^2) but most people, even though values are up there to check
                lack technical knowledge to be able to figh missinformation.

            <h2 class="subtitulo">Playing with data</h2>
            <p class="texto">To put in practice our knowledge on how to properly analyze and measure data we had to make a group 
                exercise usign predefined tools. My group composed by <a href="https://minnie-at-iaac.github.io/">Minnie,</a> 
                <a href="https://annnalozano.github.io/PaginaWeb/">Annna,</a> <a href="https://33dudu.github.io/magicreator/">Dudu</a> 
                and <a href="https://dhrishyaramadass.github.io/mdefwebsite/">Dhrishya</a> decided to to focus on connections.</p>
            <p class="texto">So question comes: How do you measure connections???  When talking about connections, one of our main interests
                was how neighbourhoods and cities have changed through the years. Poblenou was a great example of this, beign a neighbourhood
                constantly in change. to measure connections, considering a lot of new socila places have recently appeared, we decided to see
                how opened internet connections where in this areas. To do it we were limited to use just one tool for each group so we decided to
                use the barduino. As the barduino has wifi connection, we thought it will be great to use this tool to get the wifis around a place
                and how opened they are. The first problem came when we realized that data could not be saved in an arduino as it doesn't have storage
                module. to solve this, we wrote a python code to translate the info to a remote machine (minnie's laptop) so while people were taking data
                from the places, we will recieve it at the fab lab and save it in a csv file. Second problem came at the time of mixing all our data
                As we also needed the location, we use a phone app to send the coordinates at the same time but this ones alongside with the google
                maps metatdata of the places where saved in another csv so we had to create a second python script to join all the info in just one file.
                Finally, once the data was all saved, we created a third python script using libraries folium and pandas to generate a html map 
                where all the information and metadata can be visualized (You can check the map <a href="../../Code/Measuring_the_World/poblenou.html">hereüëà</a> 
                and the documentation <a href="https://hackmd.io/@usaestoparadescargar/ryR2UAlsp">hereüëà</a>). The map shows different areas in green or red
                representing open wifis around or not and bigger and smaller depending on the amount of wifis in the area.</p>

            <h2 class="subtitulo">Reflecting on the seminar</h2>
            <p class="texto">One of the key takeaways of the seminar was the importance of critical engagement with data. 
                In a society inundated with information, distinguishing between fact and fiction is paramount. Learning to 
                call out misinformation, whether it's in the form of flawed interpretations or dubious claims, emerged as a 
                crucial skill in upholding the integrity of data-driven decision-making processes. This practice isn't just 
                about skepticism; it's about accountability and transparency, ensuring that decisions are based on accurate and 
                reliable information.</p>
                <p class="texto">
                    Related to the goup work, delving into the question of how to measure connections created an intriguing 
                    discussion within our group. We acknowledged the diverse forms connections can take, from physical infrastructure 
                    to digital networks. Opting to focus on the latter, especially within neighborhoods like Poblenou undergoing rapid 
                    change, allowed us to explore dynamic urban contexts. This decision underscored our commitment to understanding how 
                    technological connectivity intersects with urban development and social dynamics. All the scripts and data of the 
                    exercise can be downloaded <a href="https://github.com/jmuozan/open-wifi-map-poblenou">hereüëà</a>
