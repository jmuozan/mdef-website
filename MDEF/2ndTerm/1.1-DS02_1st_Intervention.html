            <p class="texto">During winter break I tried to reflect on the work and interventions 
                done for the design dialogues. After making some previous research on how humans interact 
                with other living things as plants fungi‚Ä¶ I decided to make research focusing on what role 
                does digital fabrication play in this interaction between humans and non human things. As I 
                still don‚Äôt know how to mix this two subjects, I decided to aim this first intervention on the 
                empowerment and benefits of digital fabrication.

            <h2 class="subtitulo">The third digital revolution</h2>
            <p class="texto">
                The third digital revolution is a journey (that has already started) into a future where the boundaries between 
                the physical and digital worlds blur, ushering in a new era of possibilities and challenges that will shape the 
                course of the technological landscape for years to come. Nowadays, cutting-edge digital fabrication primarily 
                relies on massive machines operated by skilled professionals at research institutions and major corporations. 
                Yet, in the near future, the capabilities of these machines will be within reach for everyone, similar to how at 
                the time, pocket-sized computer people carry now rivals the computing power of a past mainframe computer.
                Here is where digital fabrication plays a huge factor. By democratizing fabrication tools and techniques (fables, 
                ateneus de fabricaci√≥, makerspaces‚Ä¶) Things that usually were expensive to make now only cost a few dollars in materials 
                and a few minutes in time. As Neil Gershenfeld writes on ‚ÄúDesigning Reality: How to Survive and Thrive in the Third Digital 
                Revolution‚Äù, the fact that now everyone has access to different tools means that everyone can be capable of making almost 
                anything and this pops up the question: What is digital fabrication good for?
            </p>
            <p class="texto">
                ‚ÄúWhile I was asking how to do it, and not why, they were showing that just as the killer app for digital computing was 
                personal computing, the killer app for digital fabrication is personal fabrication. The point was not to make what you 
                could buy in stores; it was to make what you couldn‚Äôt products for a market as small as one person.‚Äù
            </p>
            <p class="texto">
                I ended up liking a lot the last part of the quote ‚Äúproducts for a market as small as one person‚Äù. What does this 
                really mean???

            <p class="texto">
                The way I see it, the quote highlights the idea that the true power and purpose of digital fabrication lie in creating 
                customized products tailored to the individual, catering to their unique needs, preferences, and desires. Personal 
                fabrication shifts the focus from current mass production for masses to a more intimate and personal approach, allowing 
                people to design and craft items that meet with their specific requirements, making the technology a tool for self-expression 
                and individuality.
            </p>
            <p class="texto">
                I really like the terms ‚Äúintimate‚Äù, ‚Äúpersonal‚Äù, ‚Äúself-expression‚Äù and ‚Äúindividuality‚Äù because to me these terms really go 
                beyond of what we conceive today as market. At the same time they point at the future they also go backwards, when craft was 
                the only way to produce. The third digital revolution will represent the empowerment of consumers to make their own things 
                and do it the way they want.

            <h2 class="subtitulo">Case study: Ghost Guns üëª</h2>
            <p class="texto">
                While researching on the subject and trying to see how can I interact with communities for the inteervention, I found out 
                what to me might be one of the best examples about the empowerment of the users. ‚ÄúGhost Guns‚Äù. According to chatgpt:
                Ghost guns refer to firearms that are typically assembled at home by individuals, often using readily available components 
                and kits. What sets them apart is the lack of a serial number or any traceable markings, making them difficult to track by 
                law enforcement. These firearms can be constructed from 3D-printed parts, unfinished receivers, or other unregulated components, 
                allowing individuals to bypass background checks and purchase restrictions associated with commercially manufactured guns.
                The term "ghost" is used because these firearms essentially exist off the radar, making them challenging to trace or regulate. 
                People may choose to build ghost guns for various reasons, including privacy concerns, a desire to avoid government oversight, 
                or simply because they enjoy the process of crafting their own firearm.
            </p>
            <p class="texto">
                I believe the concept of ghost guns go beyond this, by seeing how different gun makers communities interact I really got 
                fascinated by how the perfectly exemplify the empowerment of makers through digital fabrication. With the rise of 3D printing 
                and easily accessible firearm components, individuals can craft their own firearms at home. This process grants them a level 
                of autonomy and self-sufficiency, tapping into the ethos of the maker movement. While the debate around regulation and safety 
                persists, the phenomenon highlights how digital fabrication technologies empower individuals to create objects that were once 
                exclusively produced by manufacturers. It raises questions about the balance between individual freedom, technological 
                innovation, and the need for responsible use and oversight.

            <p class="texto">
                I tired to contact with the community Are We Cool Yet?, one of the biggest ones in the ghost guns world trying to know more 
                about how they feel empowered through making and why do they do it but I didn‚Äôt get a response by them yet. So I will keep 
                trying with other communities and members because I‚Äôm really interested in knowing their insights.

            <h2 class="subtitulo">Reflection: How this helps my research and where should I go from here????</h2>
            <p class="texto">After reseraching about users empowerment through digital fabrication and doing the case study I question myself:
                How did all of this helped me? In the vice documentary (Where most of the pictures here taken from) the reporter mentions the fact 
                that most of the people would be unable to do a process like a ghost gun by themselves because they lack digital fabrication knwoledge. 
                This reflection had me thinking questions for my personal project. How whould it be possible to make this knowledge more available for 
                everyone? Would it be possible to also democratize bio-fabrication techniques with it? Would it be easier to do it? Is it possible to 
                simplify users and machines interactions without making blackboxes????
