Engaging with Speculative Thinking to Decolonize the Future

## Responsability

- How can we imagine a better future when the old paradigms of human exeptionalism individualism and autonomy are not good enough to understand the challenges of living and dying on a damaged planet?
- How can we practice the arts of living in multi species?
- How do we take care. Of each other, humans and non humans, rendering each other capable?

## The problem is not humanity

"Most peoples on this planet have not lived and exercised the same kinds of processes that break generations, that radically simplify ecologies, that drastically force labor in a mass way that creates a kind of global wealth that is in and of itself genocidal and extincitionist. That is not a species act; it's a situated historical set of conjunctures, and I think to this day the term Anthropocene makes it harder, not easier, for people to understand that" D.H.

## It fails as a universal problem

"My natural science colleagues--and for that matter myself and my colleagues in general--have a tendency to think that apparatuses and terminologies like, for example, climate change are going to be translatable somehow to all parts of the world, even if the phenomena in question are experienced differently." D.H.

## Human Exeptionalism

The sciences of the Anthropocene are too much contained within restrictive systems theories and within evolutionary theories called the Modern Synthesis, which for all their extraordinary importance have proven unable to think well about sympoiesis, symbiosis, symbiogenesis, development, webbed ecologies and microbes.

## Symbiosis

Symbiosis is everywhere once you start looking, from nitrogen fixing bacteria on the roots of plants, to fungi and worms, flowers that rely on pollinating insects, to the cleaning stations on coral reefs. 90% of plants have symbiotic partners. The human body is full of complementary bacteria.



Living beings defy neat definition. They fight, they feed, they dance, they mate, they die. At the base of the creativity of all large familiar forms of life, symbiosis generates novelty. It brings together different life-forms, always for a reason. Often, hunger unites the predator with the prey or the mouth with the photosynthetic bacterium or algal victim.

Symbiogenesis brings together unlike individuals to make large, more complex entities. Symbiosis is not marginal or rare phenomenon. It's natural and common. We abide in a symbiotic world









Certainly! Hereâ€™s a concise summary that captures the main ideas of Donna Haraway along with the concept of "response-ability":

Donna Haraway is a key figure in feminist theory and the philosophy of science, known for her challenging ideas on technology, identity, and human-non-human relationships. Her influential works include "A Cyborg Manifesto," where she introduces the cyborg as a boundary-crossing figure that defies traditional categories of gender, race, and class, advocating for a post-gender world. In "Situated Knowledges," Haraway argues that all knowledge is specific to its context, challenging the notion of objective truth and emphasizing the importance of understanding knowledge as inherently limited and localized.

In "The Companion Species Manifesto," she explores the deep interconnections between humans and non-human animals, underscoring co-evolution and mutual influence. Her concept of the Chthulucene proposes a new era that shifts focus from a human-centered to a multi-species perspective, highlighting the intertwined fates of various life forms on Earth.

Central to Haraway's philosophy is the notion of "response-ability," which emphasizes the ethical need to respond in ways that foster respect and accountability in relationships, not just among humans, but across species. This involves recognizing and nurturing the complex, interdependent networks that constitute our world, encouraging a more inclusive, cooperative approach to living on a shared planet. This concept is a call to action for more responsible and ethical interactions with the diverse forms of life with whom we coexist, advocating for a collaborative survival across species.
