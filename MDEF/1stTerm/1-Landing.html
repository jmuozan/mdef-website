            <p class="parrafoinicio">The first week of MDEF or ‚ÄúLanding Week‚Äù, started on Monday by visiting the installations of Fab Lab Bcn and getting to know all the teachers and classmates. During the following days of the week, teachers explained to us the different projects that they‚Äôve been part of and showed us the different possibilities that the Fab Lab offers. Next up, we were introduced to Poblenou, a neighborhood in expansion here in Barcelona. The physical space that Poblenou occupies today was a humid, swampy area. During the industrial revolution (19th century), the proximity to Barcelona, the ease and abundance of water, the barter of food, floors, and land gave a great boost to manufacturing, which chose this area to establish industries. These include activities such as bleaching, printing and dry cleaning. Nowadays, this neighborhood offers an incredible amount of possibilities for us to make interventions and collaborations. I really found this visit incredibly useful. On Thursday, in order to have a first contact with the FabLab machines, we made use of the milling and laser cutting machines to build tables for the small fabrication lab that we have set up in our class. Finally, on Friday we went to Elisava to see the facilities that the school offers. We saw the printing and fabrication workshops, and the technicians explained to us the capabilities of each machine. </p>
