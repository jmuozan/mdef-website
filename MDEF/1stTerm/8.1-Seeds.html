            <p class="texto">Join me as we embark on a seed germination exercise, where we'll witness the incredible process of a seed awakening to life. Together, we'll provide the seeds with the nurturing environment they need, carefully balancing moisture, warmth, and soil conditions. This hands-on activity isn't just about watching sprouts emerge; it's about connecting with the very essence of plant growth and understanding the delicate balance that nurtures life. So, let's start this botanical journey with excitement and curiosity, ready to watch the magic of nature unfold right before our eyes.</p>

            <h2 class="subtitulo">Choosing some seeds</h2>
            <p class="texto">We started this exercise receiving different seeds. With just the name of the seed and the distributor, we had to do some research on the kind of seed. In my case, I chose <span class="cursiva">Beveris Nervosa</span> seeds. wich is a kind of grape plant.Â </p>

            <h2 class="subtitulo">Seed research</h2>
            <p class="texto">During the research, I found out that the seeds are usually grown in Canada and the northern US, and that the seeds like cold weather and moist soils (all around the coast and waterfalls, places where there is humidity). They are capable of growing in different kinds of soils as long as they're moist. Not dry, but not watery.</p>

            <h2 class="subtitulo">Germinating them</h2>
            <p class="texto">Once the research was done, it was time to germinate the seeds. First, I picked up the soil. I decided to pick the most common soil sold at the supermarket. Then, I picked up a small greenhouse that I had around the house; this way, it would be easier to get the humidity I wanted. After I placed the seeds in the soil (not too deep), I covered them, watered them a bit, put the cover of the greenhouse on top, andÂ thenÂ I placed it next to a window, where the sun will be hitting the most. This will help create the humidity we want.Â </p>

            <h2 class="subtitulo">Next steps</h2>
            <p class="texto">To keep up with the germination process, I will keep watering the plants from time to time, always closing the top cover of the mini green house. I will also make sure that it's always facing the sun. If that's done correctly, in a couple of weeks, the seeds will start germinating.</p>
