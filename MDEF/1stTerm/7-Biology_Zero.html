Scale Geoffrey West (Book)

Microbiology: study of microscopic organisms wich are defined as any living organism that is either a single cell (unicellular) or a cell cluster. This includes fungi protists and monera
Viruses though not strictly classed as living organisms, are also studied within these fields. As well as Inmunology


CLASSIFICATION
-By nutrition: Autotropes -> needs oxigen, 
-By information management: -> Eukaryote -> Prokaryote (DNA in the nucleus or in the cytoplasm) 
-By kingdom: (-> Bacteria -> Archaea) Eukaryotes -> Protista
