# Critical Transfeminist Design



## Class 1

***La emencipación de la mujer***. Lenin

http://elpressentiment.net/?lang=en

A/ The stigma of the flesh -> the Christian pastoral care of the flesh

B/ The body as a machine -> the body as a cultural mechanism

Christian pastoral care: Everything that surrounds the body is charged with stigma. The flesh is nullified----flagellation

​	/No display of the body/

Natural mechanism: body is understood from the mechanized animal. Body as machine. Soul-body dualism. Ontological dualism

---

The emergence of phenomenology, the study of the body in its entirety begins.

2 dimensions of the body:

A. Corporeal dimension of human existence

B. Symbolic dimension

A/ Husserl-Ponty: body lived as a centre of intentionality, from the body I establish my relation with the other, A reference to the other. The body made flesh, carnally anchored in the world.

The focus of all action passes through the body.

Heidegger: affective anchoring of the individual in the world. All.vision is codified by the context.

---

B/ Lacan. Mirror theory: I see the body of the other reflected and become aware of my own selfhood as a body.

Foucault. Diff. Forms of aubjectivity of bodies:

Power: anonymous structures; subjectivation : surveillance and punishment

​	microphysics of control --> (hetero)patriarcal discourse

From a gender studies point of view:

Cyborg. Haraway "we are all chimeras, theorized and fabricated hybrids of machine and organism; in a world, we are cyborgs"

On the relationship between science, technology and society.

---

The perfromativity of the body:

Performativity: action/reaction | action

​				linguistics

Butler. 2 points about the body: on the one hand, the body does things due to processes of normalization, but on the other hand, the body has the capacity for rebellion (---Homosexuality)

Language --> Represent myself in the world

​		establish a communicative bridge

​		representing my subjective world

​	linguistic coding marks the regulating meaning

​	language----meaning horizon/ acts/

​	meaning horizon-->normativisation----uniformisation

---

We are always already linguistically pre-constituted.

​	The self is blurred in different liguistic attitudes

 - Where is the freedom or autonomy of the self?

    - How to avoid determinism?
 - Implementing the processes of resignification

*Wittgenstein*

---

The norm is made effective by constant repetition, temporality?

- Revision of regulative ideals:
  - Incorporaron of corrective practices, due to the dynamic character of the norm itself.

There are certain moments when language and body do not coincide--> This is where implementation can take place.

 - queer
   - **Body as an active principle of resignification**

---

The methaphysics of lack, shared by certain theologies and certain forms of psychoanalysis, would like to convince us that we all lack somethin. We are told that the world is in order because women lack the "transcendental phallus" -or the megadildus. We are told that animals lack soul, and that cybernetic machines lack the flesh and the will that electrical connections come to compensate for with an excess of information... We lack nothing. Deleuze and Guattari had already said it. We lack neither the penis nor the breasts. The body is already a territory through which multiple organs and diverse identities cross. What we lack is the desire, the rest is enough.

Paul B. Preciado. *Contrasexual Manifesto*

 POWER AS Negative/restrictive/oppressive =
potestas (=> politics as usual)
Positive/affirmative/empowering = potentia (=>
the political)
CRITIQUE AS CREATIVITY

Subaltern Gramsci (Prison notebooks, 1929-35)

- ﻿﻿Subordination in the framework of capitalism_Marx
- ﻿﻿Reflec. On Hegemony_Gramsci
- ﻿﻿Subaltern as an expression of the experience and subjective condition of the subordinate, determined by a relation of domination - in Gramscian terms, of hegemony (draft of a theory of subalternity_posterior).

---

"The subordinate classes always suffer from the initiative of the ruling class, even when they revolt"

---

**Subaltern studies group**

- Hindu historiándolos trained in the UK in the 1980s
- To reveal and reveal the point of view of subalterns
- On denied voices
- Critique of Eurocentrism/Ethnocentrism
- Colonialism and Cultural Hegemony

"The master's house can never be demolished with the master's tools" *Audre Lorde*

**Gayatri Spivak**

1942, Bally ginge, Kolkata.

Education: Rabindra Bharati University

Influenced by: Michel Foucault, Jaques Derrida

Epistemic Violence

"The clearest available example of such epistemic violence is the remotely orchestrated, far-flung, and heterogeneous project to constitute the colonial subject as Other. This project is also the asymmetrical obliteration of the trace of that Other in its precarious Subject-vitiy. It is well known that Foucault locates epistemic violence, a complete overhaul of the episteme, in the redefinition of sanity at the end of the European eighteenth century. But what if that particular redefinition was only a part of the narrative of history in Europe as well as in the colonies? What if the two projects of epistemic overhaul worked as dislocated and unacknowledged parts of a vast two-handed engine?"

The term 'intersectionality', was coined by the Black feminist lawyer, Professor Kimberlé Williams Crenshaw in 1989.

On the experiences of racism and sexism of Black women.

Intersectionality_became an analytical tool for looking/measuring at how different power structures interlink, function and impact on people's' experiences in feminism and other liberation movements.

The complex, cumulative way in which the effects of multiple forms of discrimination (racism, sexism, classism...) intersect.

---

"The subaltern subject cannot speak because it does not have a place of enunciation that allows it. Women occupy this radical place because of their double condition as women and colonial subjects. The dominant discourse renders the colonised or subaltern incapable of reasoning for themselves, always needing the mediation and representation of the "first world intellectual". There is no chance for the subaltern to learn the languages of the West and at the same time remain in his or her native context. Either one is a first world intellectual with full capacity to speak, or one is a silenced subaltern."

Spivak

Transfeminism is a part of what is known as new feminisms. It expands the subjects considered within feminism to include others who are also oppressed by cisheteropatriarchy, who are not necessarily cisgender women.

Transfeminism understands the concept of gender as a social construction used to oppress and exclude.

Transfeminists identify patriarchal oppression not within genders themselves, but in the inflexible binary system

'man/woman' and the fact that gender is associated to sex. Therefore, while transfeminism proposes the existence of as many genders as there are identities, gender critical feminism desires for there to be none.

Transfeminism highlights the fact that society privileges people who identify with the gender they were assigned at birth (cisgender people) and that, because it is a binary system, it only recognizes two genders (men and women), which marginalizes any other gender. However, it does not consider gender itself as good or bad. It defines it as a subjective personal and individual condition which should not be limited to masculine/feminine (there should be an infinite number of gender identities, which is why they recognize non-binary genders)

The subjects of feminism are not just cisgender women-who identify with the gender they have -but also trans people and others who are oppressed by cisheteropatriarchy.
