**Step 1 CLUSTERS**

FOR MONDAY 15: Why this cluster? Criteria? Who? Based on what? (topic, narrative, materials, infrastructure, alternative formats that may work together, type of activities...) 

TIP: Think of clusters as a group of friends or a collective, with different skills and ideas, who decide to join forces while maintaining their differences. Think of a cluster as a concert with different bands sharing a stage.

EXTRA TIP: it all starts with your own project and how you'd like to show it / explain it to others (to whom?) / make it happen somewhere somehow

END RESULT (at the end of the whole process):

\- Name

\- - Subtitle

\- - Modality

\- - - - Activities (workshops, installations, talks, etc.)

\- - - - Venues

\- - - - - Calendar (activities, venues, date)

**Step 2 (Monday 15) MAKE CLUSTERS WORK**

Aim of this class

- Defining clusters

- Discussing conceptualization and research

- Discussing possible formats and relationship with the local ecosystem (they don't have to be final)

**TASK** **FOR MONDAY 22**

Come out with what you'd like to do, individually first and then , possibly, as a cluster; bring forward different possibilities, don't worry to come up with the final, perfect idea. Feel free to bring up alternatives.

**SUBTASK FOR MONDAY 22**

Clean up your space in this pad. Save your valuable ideas elsewhere and share here only what is important for the stage of the work you're in.

**Step 3 BUILDING A PROJECT WITH A RECOGNIZABLE CHARACTER/IDENTITY**

(When we say 'project' we mean any project: your own or the whole cluster proposal. But start from your own, first).





**Cluster 2**:

  

**Class 1:**

Cluster Team Members 

- Carlotta Hylkema

- Jorge DLM

- Jorge Munoz 

- Manuja Agnihotri

- Marius Schairer

- Nuria Valsells 

- Oliver Lloyd

- Sophie Marandon

Why this Cluster?

- We as a group have similar interests that we can potentially combine to create a collective narrative. 

What are we working on? 

- Manuja: To generate electricity and store it through sustainable methods that can be created with low technology equipment easily available in households.

- Marius & Nuria: The Project is questioning how we use methodologies/technologies, to change the perception and engagement of citizens within their surroundings.

- Jorge DLM & Sophie:Using Emergent Tech to envision preferable futures in Policymaking and Mobility 

- Oliver and Carlotta: the energy transition and how we can help people feel empowered and enabled to shift their habits towards energy consumption reduction through household interactions and technologies.

- Jorge Munoz:

The possible topics to work with are - 

- City collaboration

- Built environments

- Participation behavior

- Sustainable Energy

- Artisan inclusion

- Tech and foresight

The possible narratives could be - 

- Responsible Tech optimism

- People focused tech optimism

- People & Planet focussed design

- Emergent tech

- Powering technology sustainably 

What is the criteria?

- The goal is to reach out to communities or ecosystems that can help us communicate our collective idea or vision of city planning/development, emerging technologies and energy consumption & generation. We plan on collaborating as a group with our projects to showcase our outcomes and narrate it with stakeholders interested for now and for the future.

**Class 2:** **Concepts and formats**

For 29/04/2024: Oliver & Carlotta

The Concept for Now: To use the energy monitor and bot to create an interactive and collaborative experience that visualises and humanises the total amount of energy we use in a day, that works as an educational tool to help us understand and reduce our total energy consumption in a way that doesn't reduce our quality of life. Which aims to galvanise people to want to participate in enacting and demanding positive change. 

The Idea:

create a phygital interactive display and exhibit that asks people to take part in deciding the directions of future total energy consumption projects and research, while passively causing them to reflect on their own energy consumption and desire for change.

Locations:

- Fabra i Coats: Fabrica de Creacio

- (maybe for everyone) --> Might be hard cause of confusing for direction, through residents?) 

- Ateneu Gracia

- (a bit smaller, but could accomodate entire cluster maybe)

- https://www.ateneubcn.org/espais/espais-singulars/entrada-carruatges

- Santa Monica 

- Through residents

- Canodrom?

- (haven't spoken to them yet, need to check out space)

- https://ajuntament.barcelona.cat/centrescivics/es/espacios - Civic Centre

Communities:

- People we invite from abroad

- Som Energia reps

- citizens of BCN

- Research Participants

- Ateneu people

Manuja 22-04-2024 - Energy Independence

The Concept - To create multiple different low tech sustainable energy generating 'products' to power different projects within the cluster. To hold a workshop during the MDEFEST to methodically step by step show how to create it themselves from the low-tech equipment usually easily available at homes.

Different 'Products'

\- CD + Copper wire - DIY Solar Panel (sunlight)

\- DIY Recycled Material Wind Turbines (windy)

\- Cycling motor (unstable)

\- Stepping weight to electricity

\- Soil Battery (not powerful enough)

Nurius

The Concept for now:

LAIA is a framework we have designed to capture the collective knowledge of a community, to further process it in a collective intelligence artifact that can be used to enhace participation and awareness within the community and its enviroment. At this time, LAIA is being applied to the community of the neighbourhood El Clot. We have undertaken different workshops and today we present the current stage of the artifact that embodies the collective voice of the neighbourhood.

Format: Wrap-up event with the communities of El Clot we have collaborated with to present the final stage of our project and let them give us feed back, try it out, talk about fitire projects... Hosted in the *Akasha Hub.*

Jorge Muñoz

Concept: Would like to make a practical exercise showcasing the use of deep learning, to preserve traditional craftsmanship skills to new generations. The system will offer an educational platform that instructs users in the use of the turntable. The goal of the installation is to globalize and modernize the transmission of ancient knowledge, making it accessible and engaging.

Format: 

**Class 3: Venue + name + activites**

NAME: ACT - Actively Creating Tomorrow

SUBTITLE: 

  *Futures We Choose Now*

  

- \- citizens participation

- \- interaction

- \- small action that can trigger bigger change: technologies that can enable small action that trigger bigger ones

- \- responsible emergent technologies to shape the future

- \- not only talking about futures, take the steps to get to them

- \- tools for a response-able future

- \- Prototyping Futures

- \- 

VENUES:

  **-Canòdrom** **--> Laura is contacting them**

  -Bloc4

  **-Akasha Hub - Nurius & others?**

  -Ateneu Fabricació de Gracia

  -Fabra i Coats residents

  -Santa Monica residents

FORMATS:

Nurius: Display/Showcasing of the prototype + inviting people to play with it

Vania&JorgeM: Display/Showcasing of the prototype + inviting people to play with it 

Oliver&Carlotta: Display/Showcasing of the prototype + inviting people to play with it

Manuja: Display/Showcasing of the prototype + inviting people to play with it

Sophie: Intervention in the public space to interact with random people

JorgeDML: Display/Showcasing of the prototype + inviting people to play with it

PLAN A: All together in the same venue

\- We need to "relate" to the context of the venue - make it make sense

\- Transversal explanation of every project on "how is this a preferable future?"

\- Slogan, for example: "Imagine a future with..." and each project takes the slogan in their own way. At the end of the event, we relate every project to create a "preferable future"

\- A poster/Graphic identity or so for the whole group that explains the connections/event

\- Reference: vests "I work for..." in Fixing the Futures

PLAN B: Different venues across tha city

\- Scavenger hunt, make it a game to collect different experiences to understand the "preferable future"

\- Through creating triggers/messages PreferableFuture causes people to want to wander from 1 place to another and learn more about how small actions can create large change.
