# Atlas of Weak Signals

A weak signal can be seen as an early sign, hinting at future changes that might not have a significant impact at the moment but could potentially lead to major events down the line. These signals are pioneers, pointing towards emerging trends and the specific directions they’re heading, helping to anticipate the future. Essentially, they represent situations before they are widely recognized. Finding them and understanding them before they become “strong” is essential in future research. In order to detect them, we, the researchers of the future, should try to address the surrounding issues while pushing the boundaries between mainstream society and the future of technologies. 
To help researchers find these “weak” signals, José Luis de Vicente and Mariana Quintero created the Atlas of the Weak Signals, a card game that can be used as a tool to facilitate seeking opportunities, threats, challenges and shared visions for innovation, policymaking, intervention, research and business opportunities in the future.
