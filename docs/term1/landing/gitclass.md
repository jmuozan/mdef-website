## **_Landing week_** 

**<sub> 2/10/2023 - 6/10/2023 <sub>**

The first week of MDEF started by visiting the installations of Fab Lab Bcn and understanding the concept of Fab Labs. By showing us the different types of projects done in Fab Labs we understood their democratizing effect on technology. Fab Labs provide access to advanced tools and machines, such as 3D printers, laser cutters, and CNC machines, which were once restricted to industrial settings. By making these technologies accessible to individuals, Fab Labs empower people to turn their ideas into tangible prototypes. This democratization fosters a culture of innovation, enabling grassroots inventors and entrepreneurs to bring their visions to life. By adding education such as MDEF, Fab Academy, Fabricademy… students develop essential skills such as collaboration, critical thinking, and digital literacy.
Next up, the teachers introduced us to Poblenou, a neighborhood in expansion where Fab Lab Bcn is located. We visited the different kinds of businesses located there and saw an incredible amount of opportunities for collaboration.
On Thursday, we inquired about the power of documentation. As future researchers we should document everything we do: pictures, audios, videos, text… That way, information can be made public and accessible. To do this documentation, we were introduced to web development. By using Git, Git Hub and VS Code, we learned how to do a basic web where we will document all the work that we will do in the master.
Lastly, we made use of the Fab Lab installations by making the structure for our own digital fabrication lab. We used de CNC router to cut the pieces and then we sanded, varnished and assembled them.
