These signals are pioneers, pointing towards emerging trends and the specific directions they\u2019re heading, helping to anticipate the future. Essentially, they represent situations before they are widely recognized. Finding them and understanding them before they become \u201cstrong\u201d is essential in future research. In order to detect them, we, the researchers of the future, should try to address the surrounding issues while pushing the boundaries between mainstream society and the future of technologies. To help researchers find these \u201cweak\u201d signals, Jos\u00e9 Luis de Vicente and Mariana Quintero created the Atlas of the Weak Signals, a card game that can be used as a tool to facilitate seeking opportunities, threats, challenges and shared visions for innovation, policymaking, intervention, research and business opportunities in the future. https://fablabbcn.org/blog/emergent-ideas/atlas-of-weak-signals Atlas of Weak Signals group exercise \u00b6 To properly understand how to find weak signals, we played the card game Boy Groups. My group, composed of Jorge de la Mora, Francisca and Ana started pulling out the refugee tech and the carbon-neutral lifestyle Weak Signals cards. Here we discussed how refugee camps like the one in Kutupalong in Cox\u2019s Bazar situated in Bangladesh, home to 880000 refugees, doesn\u2019t have the resources to build first need products like water cleaners, gardens to cultivate food, and generators of electricity. Considering the political conditions that surround this type of camps, we thought a carbon-neutral approach to this problem would be a good kind of intervention. Trying to create products from scratch only using things that are accessible in this kind of camps. We also discussed the possibility of sending digital fabrication machines like 3D printers and how maker education will help repair and create useful things. Next up, we picked the Circular Economy and Supply Chain Innovation Areas of Opportunity cards. By adding this to the equation, we discussed the repairability of products nowadays and how we should, as consumers demand more easily reparable products, force companies to change the location of their production in order to create a more sustainable consumption process. We also discussed, how we could try to promote a more circular way of consuming by buying secondhand and supporting local businesses. Finally, we took out the Random Trigger cards. In this case, we chose microbiotic literacy and Neighborhood Fab Labs. These helped to dig deeper into the maker education previously mentioned and the repairability of products. Also helped us think about the building of our own products at the Fab Labs. This would also favor the principles of circular economy. We also discussed the education in microbiotics, that could be applied to the refugee camps already mentioned. My own Atlas of Weak Signals \u00b6 First phase, Weak Signals \u00b6 Pull out two WS cards //Redesigning Social Media Carbon Neutral Lifestyle// With these two cards, we can talk about how every day, thanks to social media, we\u2019re more connected to what\u2019s happening globally. Maybe by using social media as a way to make people more conscious of the problems of climate change and global capitalism and make them realize the \u201cpower\u201d that we all possess while being united, we can make big corporations change their environmental approaches and offer more sustainable products. Second phase, Areas of Opportunity \u00b6 Pull out two AoO cards //Digital Fabrication Circular Economy// Adding these two new cards to the equation, we can now try to talk about how implementing digital fabrication in everyday life can make people have a more sustainable approach to consuming. Instead of buying a new chair at IKEA, for example, we can just buy locally produced wood and cut the pieces to assemble one with a router CNC in a workshop next to home. That way, we reduce the impact of buying a chair, and we favor the principles of the circular economy. Also, social media can be used to share open-source models of furniture and other things that people might need to manufacture locally. Third phase, Random Trigger \u00b6 Pull out two RT cards //Neighbourhood Fab Labs Plastic Digestion// Finally, with these two last cards, we can try and relate the whole thing: to achieve a more sustainable way of consuming, using less plastic and following the principles of the circular economy, we can try to promote buying products locally. Artisan products embody the term \u201csustainable, being produced locally and mostly with locally and sustainably produced materials. The problem with artisan products is that most of them are expensive because of the way they\u2019re manufactured. By teaching artisans how to implement digital fabrication thanks to the Fab Labs close to them, the manufacturing process of their products will be drastically reduced. Adding to this an intense social media campaign promoting buying local as well as courses to study and implement digital fabrication so artisans can easily reach them, we might be able to change the approach to consumption.

These methods offer deep insights into individual thoughts, emotions, and behaviors, emphasizing the importance of subjective experiences. Researchers maintain diaries, use photographs, or engage in creative expression to convey their perspectives. Significantly, first-person methods promote empathy, challenge traditional research objectivity, offer cultural and social insights, and can drive social change by amplifying marginalized voices. Incorporating these methods enriches research, fostering a more authentic understanding of human experiences and societal phenomena. Once an hypothesis is created trough first person perspective, a prototype is created. Prototypes serve as experiments meticulously crafted to scrutinize specific hypotheses. These hypotheses, often grounded in innovative concepts or design theories, are not merely theoretical ideas but are physically embedded within the tangible form of the prototype. This physical embodiment is what distinguishes prototypes from abstract concepts wrote on paper. Prototypes can be classified in 4 different categories, depending on the role they preform: 1- Prototypes as experimental components: Prototypes in this role serve as essential building blocks in the world of design and innovation. They come to life in the form of physical or digital models that represent a new product, system, or concept. These experimental prototypes act as real-world simulations. Designers use them to test specific ideas or theories they have about a product or a user experience. By observing how people interact with these prototypes, designers can gather crucial data. They can see what works well and what doesn\u2019t, allowing them to tweak and refine their ideas based on actual user interactions.Each prototype version is faced as an experiment, helping designers understand what aspects of their design are effective and what aspects need improvement. 2- The prototype as a means of inquiry: This is a more scientific approach to prototyping. Prototypes in this role are meticulously crafted instruments that are used to observe and understand how their hypothesis interacts with the natural world, designers create prototypes to explore and comprehend the world of human interactions with products, systems, and ideas. These prototypes are tailored to collect data, record observations, and measure user reactions and behaviors. By deploying prototypes, designers can explore the complexities of human interactions by observing how individuals respond to different designs, interfaces, and functionalities. 3- The prototype as a research archetype: This is the most \u201cartistic\u201d approach to prototyping. In this context, the process of prototyping becomes a form of investigation, similar to a research method. Designers document, analyze, and critically evaluate the process. The focus isn\u2019t on the final product but on how the prototype was developed. The research contribution is linked more to the methods involved in creating the prototype rather than the prototype itself. 4- The process of prototyping as a vehicle for inquiry: In this method, the prototype is created in order to help an investigation that doesn\u2019t have a clear path. By making prototypes the researcher closes down the focus of the investigation. Marius\u2019 prototype \u00b6 During class, we\u2019ve tried to create a prototype for a friend\u2019s inquiry. In my case, I tried to prototype Marius\u2019 project. The project consisted of a series of sensors used on an interior garden module. These sensors were programmed to water and illuminate the plants in order to make them grow without help. For the prototyping phase, I decided to approach it using the second role of prototyping as a means of inquiry. By using cardboard, I decided to create the structure of the \u201cgarden,\u201d and with marbles and plasteline I recreated the seeds and the plants growing. On one of the sides, with cardboard and popsicles, I created the sensors. This conceptual prototype can be used to study where the sensors are better positioned to help the plants grow. By changing the position of the sensors and studying the data of the plant\u2019s growth, researchers can know what parameters and what position are better.","title":"Design Studio"},{"location":"term1/03-Design%20Studio/#design-studio","text":"","title":"Design Studio"},{"location":"term1/03-Design%20Studio/#roles-of-prototyping-in-1pp-research-through-design","text":"9/10/2023","title":"Roles of Prototyping in 1PP Research through Design"},{"location":"term1/03-Design%20Studio/#reflections","text":"The first-person research methods, encompassing approaches like autoethnography, self-observation, personal narratives, and creative expression, involve researchers studying their own experiences within specific social or cultural contexts.

Fab Labs provide access to advanced tools and machines, such as 3D printers, laser cutters, and CNC machines, which were once restricted to industrial settings. By making these technologies accessible to individuals, Fab Labs empower people to turn their ideas into tangible prototypes. This democratization fosters a culture of innovation, enabling grassroots inventors and entrepreneurs to bring their visions to life. By adding education such as MDEF, Fab Academy, Fabricademy\u2026 students develop essential skills such as collaboration, critical thinking, and digital literacy. Next up, the teachers introduced us to Poblenou, a neighborhood in expansion where Fab Lab Bcn is located. We visited the different kinds of businesses located there and saw an incredible amount of opportunities for collaboration. On Thursday, we inquired about the power of documentation. As future researchers we should document everything we do: pictures, audios, videos, text\u2026 That way, information can be made public and accessible. To do this documentation, we were introduced to web development. By using Git, Git Hub and VS Code, we learned how to do a basic web where we will document all the work that we will do in the master.
