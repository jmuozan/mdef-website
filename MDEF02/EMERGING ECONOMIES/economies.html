            <p>The Emerging Economies seminar examines how design influences new economic models. Each session delves into real-world projects developed primarily at Fab Lab Barcelona over the last ten years, combining theoretical analysis with practical case studies. Topics covered include circular and distributed economies, ecological interactions, regenerative economies, social entrepreneurship, and the future of work. Throughout the seminar, students will critically assess the potential of design to drive systemic change and tackle contemporary challenges, focusing on real-world applications and collaborative projects.</p>

            <h2>Circular Economies and Value Flows</h2>
            <p>After attending today's talk on circular economies, I realized that my perspective hasn't shifted much, likely because I’ve already spent time considering the problems of trying to implement circular solutions within a capitalist, growth-obsessed system. While the conversation reinforced the critical flaws of techno-optimistic approaches, it didn’t offer any new insights. Still, it’s a useful reminder to keep looking beyond conventional models, especially when thinking about sustainable design. Artisanship, with its emphasis on local production, resourcefulness, and minimal waste, remains a powerful example of a workable circular economy—one I will continue exploring in my own project. Ultimately, true transformation will require us to reconsider the whole framework, not just tweak the existing one. Until then, my thoughts from before the talk still stand</p>

            <h2>Distributed Economies and Massive Collaboration</h2>
            <p>Today's session on distributed economies and massive collaboration didn’t drastically reshape my views, but it did offer some fresh projects to explore. Having already read about distributed design through the Fab Cities model, a lot of what was discussed felt familiar. The key takeaway remains consistent with my existing beliefs: global knowledge paired with local, sustainable production is transformative. Artisanship embodies this ideal, where the blend of "slow" and localized production aligns perfectly with distributed economy principles. My conviction remains that shifting from mass, centralized production to these models is essential if we are to create meaningful change in the current system.</p>

            <h2>Social Entrepreneurship and Impact Economies</h2>
            <p>Coming into today's talk on social entrepreneurship, I had zero knowledge about these ideas. The session opened my eyes to how businesses can make money while helping society at the same time. I learned about exciting projects around the world where communities work together using open-source ideas to solve local problems. What struck me most was seeing how regular people can be both creators and users of these business models, not just customers. This new understanding has got me thinking about starting my own open-source project. The big lesson? Communities are the key to making businesses that work for everyone, not just for profit. It's amazing to see how working together can create businesses that make both money and positive change.</p>

            <h2>Regenerative Economies and Social Sustainability</h2>
            <p>Today's session on regenerative economies mostly confirmed what I already believed - that building economic relationships through communities can really pay off. While I was already familiar with this idea, learning about projects like CENTRINO was interesting. The talk reinforced my commitment to working with maker communities and exploring open-source innovation. These communities are already well-established in creating local solutions, making them perfect partners for new projects. The main point that stuck with me is how economies become stronger when we share knowledge openly and work together to boost local production. Nothing completely new, but it's always good to see real examples backing up what you believe in.</p>
